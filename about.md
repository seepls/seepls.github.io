Hello! I am a Quantitative Finance professional based in London, specializing in Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) and XVA (Valuation Adjustments). I have experience working with globally systemically important financial institutions.

I hold both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics and Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India.

My interests include:
- Applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in CCR
- Extending these applications to crypto and energy assets

I am passionate about leveraging quantitative methods to solve real-world financial problems. I am currently open to new opportunities—particularly interested in joining innovative startups or organizations like Bloomberg.

Feel free to connect if you’d like to collaborate or discuss opportunities!
