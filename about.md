I am currently a Quant Finance professional, mainly working in Counterparty Credit Risk(CCR) and XVA(Valuation Adjustments). I have experience working with Global Systematically Important banks, namely Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.

  
I have persued my undergraduate Bachelors and Masters in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kharagpur, INDIA. 


I'm interested and trying to apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning application in Risk as well as CCR application crypto pricing.
