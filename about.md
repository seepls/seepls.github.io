I am currently a Quantitative Finance professional, primarily working in Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) and XVA (Valuation Adjustments). I have experience working with globally systemically important banks, namely Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.

I have pursued my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics and Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India.

I am interested in applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in CCR and extending its application in crypto and energy asset.
